Meeting 2 Notes

We talked about criteria we wanted our website to fulfill.

We assigned tasks for next week. Milan is going to assemble training data for images,
Josh will look into neural network options and libraries, Owen will assemble meme text training data,
Nick will produce a prototype webpage, Kyle will look into using NodeJS as a middle layer between database and webpage.
