Meeting 3 notes

We chose specific architecture. We'll deploy on Heroku App, use NodeJS for the
middle layer, and PostgreSQL for the database. We'll use python for the machine
learning and training our algorithm.

We reported and presented progress for the week, and discussed challenges of different meme formats
and website requirements.

We worked on Milestone 2.
