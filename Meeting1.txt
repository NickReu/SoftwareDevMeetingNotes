Meeting 1, 9/27:

Everyone but Kyle was present, but we still were able to add Kyle to our GroupMe and github repos.

We set up GitHub repositories, a Google doc, and a GroupMe.

We worked on milestone one, which included voting on our team name and our project idea.

We emailed Chelsea and Alan to get info on how to share the github repos with them.
